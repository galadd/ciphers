## Cipher Choices 

These are the following ciphers available on the console application:

### 1. Caesar 
A Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The Caesar cipher is easily broken and is not considered secure for modern communication.

### 2. Baconian 
A Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The Caesar cipher is easily broken and is not considered secure for modern communication.

### 3. Gronsfeld
To encode a message using the Gronsfeld cipher, you need a key, which is a series of digits. Each digit in the key specifies the shift for the corresponding character in the message. For example, if the key is "123" and the message is "HELLO", the encoded message would be:

H + 1 = I </br>
E + 2 = G </br>
L + 3 = O </br>
L + 1 = M </br>
O + 2 = Q

So the encoded message would be "IGOMQ".

### 4. Porta
To encode a message using the Porta cipher, you need a key, which is a series of letters. Each letter in the key specifies the shift for the corresponding character in the message. The shift value for each letter is calculated by subtracting the letter from 'A' (for uppercase characters) or 'a' (for lowercase characters).
